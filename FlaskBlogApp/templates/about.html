          <p>Hey everyone !!! My name is Rishi Deorukhkar and I am from Mumbai.
             I have been working as a software developer since 2015.
             Programming mainly in C, C++, Python and Unix shell.</p>
          <p>In the recent years I have grown really fond of programming in Python.
             On this blog site I will be posting some of my Python and other hobby projects
             which I have been working on.</p>
